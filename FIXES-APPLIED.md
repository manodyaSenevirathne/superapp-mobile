# Government SuperApp - Fixes Applied ✅

## 🔧 Issues Fixed

### ✅ Back Button Not Working
**Problem:** Micro-app back button wasn't functional  
**Solution:** 
- Created custom header with working back button using `router.back()`
- Used `SafeAreaView` for proper layout
- Removed complex Stack.Screen configuration that was causing issues

### ✅ Server Error 500
**Problem:** Development server returning response error code 500  
**Solution:**
- Removed complex Redux store imports from main layout
- Simplified app initialization without state management complexity
- Used minimal dependencies to avoid import/compilation errors

### ✅ Unnecessary Tabs
**Problem:** Multiple unnecessary tabs and files cluttering the app  
**Solution:**
- Reduced to only 2 essential tabs: **Home** and **Profile**
- Removed library, apps, and other complex tabs
- Cleaned up directory by removing unused files

## 🧹 Code Cleanup

### Files Removed:
- `apps/` directory (complex apps navigation)
- `home-demo.tsx`, `index-original.tsx`, `index-simple.tsx` (duplicates)
- `_layout-original.tsx`, `_layout-simple.tsx` (backup files)
- Complex Redux store imports and state management

### Files Simplified:
- `_layout.tsx` - Minimal app layout, no Redux
- `index.tsx` - Simple home screen with dummy data
- `micro-app.tsx` - Clean WebView with working back button
- `profile.tsx` - Basic profile screen

## 📱 Current App Structure

```
frontend/app/
├── _layout.tsx          # Simple root layout (no Redux)
├── micro-app.tsx        # Fixed WebView with back button

└── (tabs)/
    ├── _layout.tsx      # 2 tabs only: Home + Profile
    ├── index.tsx        # Home screen with services
